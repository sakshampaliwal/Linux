find -mmin 5 --> it lists files that modified exactly 5 min before
find -mmin -5 --> it lists files that modifies in last 5min
find -mmin +5 --> it lists files that modified before 5min to infinity
find -size 512k--> it lists files exactly 512 kilobytes
find -size -512k--> it lists files less than
find -size +512k--> it lists files more than
find -name "f*" --> we can find files start with letter f by wildcard format
find -name "f*" -size 512k --> it means and operator
find -name "f*" -o -size 512k --> it means or operator
find -not -name "f*" --> file that do not start with letter f
find -perm 664 --> files with exactly 664 permissions

Locate Command:
This command is often quicker and can search the entire file system with ease.
find Searches the file system in real-time, which means it looks for files and directories by scanning your computer's storage at the moment you run the command.
whereas locate Uses a pre-built list (database) of files and their locations on your computer.
Searches this pre-built database, which makes it much faster.

Syntax: locate query

The locate command relies on a pre-built database of files, which is typically updated regularly by a background process (such as updatedb). 
However, if you want to ensure that the database is up to date before running a search, you can use the "sudo updatedb" command to manually update it:

By default, locate searches the entire file system. If you want to limit the search to a specific directory or path, you can specify it as an argument: 
locate -r /path/to/search/in

Count no of matches: locate -c example.txt
Limit Results to a Maximum Number: locate -n 5 example.txt
