Sudoers file:
- It is a configuration file that defines who can run specific commands with elevated privileges using the sudo command. 
  It allows system administrators to delegate limited superuser powers to regular users or groups of users while maintaining control over system security.
- It is typically located at /etc/sudoers
- It is the file of rules, regulations, and action list for the “sudo”. It tells the “sudo” to which user to give the 
  root privileges and allow them to have a super user permission and which user to deny an access to the root privileges. 
  It can also enable a certain user to execute a command as any other user in the system. 
- you need to get the administrator rights to open the sudoer file.
- When you install os it automatically adds the first user to the sudoer file with administrative rights. 
  The first user can run the commands like install, update, etc with the “sudo” command after the installation is done. 
  But, when a new user is added by default, no administrative rights are assigned to it. To give the administrative rights or the super user access 
  to the new user, the sudoer file needs to be edited and the new user needs to be added to the sudoer file.
- Use visudo in the terminal to edit sudoer files and avoid using a text editor to prevent corrupting other files and accidentally removing admin access.

Syntax:

For Individual user:
alice    ALL=(ALL:ALL)   ALL
//when you want to grant sudo privileges to a specific individual user, you do not use the % symbol. 

For Groups:
%admins  ALL=(ALL:ALL)   ALL
//When you want to grant sudo privileges to a group of users, you use the % symbol before the group name

Combinig user and group:
alice, %admins    ALL=(ALL:ALL)   /bin/ls, /bin/cat


E.g:
alice    ALL=(ALL:ALL)   ALL
%admins  ALL=(ALL:ALL)   ALL
alice    ALL=(ALL:ALL)   ALL, !/usr/bin/passwd   //we are saying that all command can be allowed to execute but denied permission to run the /usr/bin/passwd command with sudo
alice    ALL=(ALL:ALL)   /bin/ls, /bin/cat   // Alice can run /bin/ls and /bin/cat with elevated privileges using sudo.
