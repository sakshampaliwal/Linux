Watch command:
- It is used to execute a command repeatedly at specified intervals and display the output in the terminal.
- It primarily revolving around monitoring changes or continuous updates in command output. 
- It’s most commonly used to track system uptime, memory, or disk usage. 
- The Linux watch command will run simultaneously in the terminal until stopped by pressing CTRL+C.
- Syntax: watch [options] command

E.g: watch -n 2 ls -l  //to monitor the output of the ls -l command every 2 seconds

- Linux watch command runs the user-defined command every two seconds. However, users can easily change the interval by changing its options.

some options:
-d, –differences: Displays the differences between watch command updates. 
-n, –interval: Allows users to specify the time interval between output updates in seconds.
-g : It stops the specified command whenever there are changes in memory consumption.

iostat command:
- It is used to display input/output statistics for devices and partitions.
- When experiencing slow system performance or I/O-related problems, It identifies which disks or partitions are experiencing heavy usage, high wait times, or high utilization, which can pinpoint where the performance bottleneck might be occurring.
- It provides insights into CPU utilization, disk I/O, and overall system load caused by I/O operations. 

[iostat uses files mentioned below to create the reports:  
/proc/stat Contains the system statistics.
/proc/uptime Contains the system uptime.
/proc/diskstats Contains the disks statistics.
/sys Contains the statistics for block devices.
/proc/self/mountstats Contains the statistics for network filesystems.
/dev/disk Contains the persistent device names.]

- Syntax: iostat [options] [device names]
E.g: iostat -d 2 6   //display device (disk) statistics at an interval of 2 seconds, generating 6 reports in total.

This command will show disk-related statistics like:

[Device: The name of the device being monitored.
tps (transactions per second): The number of I/O transactions completed per second (combined reads and writes).
kB_read/s: Kilobytes read per second.
kB_wrtn/s: Kilobytes written per second.
kB_read: Total kilobytes read.
kB_wrtn: Total kilobytes written.]

sar command:
- It is used to collect, report, and analyze system activity. It stands for "System Activity Reporter" and is part of the sysstat package in most Linux distributions.


- Syntax: sar [options] [interval] [count]

E.g: sar -u 5 3  //Monitor CPU usage every 5 seconds for 3 reports.
sar -r 10 2  //Monitor memory usage every 10 seconds for 2 reports.

[CPU Usage: To view CPU-related statistics:

-u: Displays CPU utilization statistics.
-r: Shows memory utilization statistics.
-d: Shows disk utilization statistics.
-n: Displays network statistics.
-n DEV: Shows network interface statistics.]

lsof command:
- It stands for List Open Files.
- It is for listing down all the open files of a system.
- It is used to list information about files that are currently open by processes. This includes regular files, directories, sockets, pipes, devices, and more. 
- Running lsof without any arguments will list all open files on the system along with information about the associated processes.
- Syntax: lsof [options]

E.g: lsof -i  //Displaying Network Connections
lsof -p <PID>  //Listing Files by a Specific Process ID (PID)
lsof -u <username>  //Listing Files by a Specific User

fuser:
- It is used to identify processes that are currently using specific files, directories, or block devices.
- Syntax: fuser [options] file/directory/block-device
- 


chroot command:
lvscan
vgchange
chroot
