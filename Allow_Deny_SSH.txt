sshd_config file:
- The OpenSSH server reads a configuration file when it is started. Usually, this file is /etc/ssh/sshd_config, but the location can be changed using the -f command line option when starting sshd.
- Some organizations run multiple SSH servers at different port numbers, specifying a different configuration file for each server using this option.
- The default values for certain configuration options in OpenSSH are quite restrictive and often need to be changed. Usually this is done by editing the default configuration file to change just a few options.
- It tells the server how to behave and who can connect to it.
- You can allow or deny specific users or groups from connecting to the server.
- You can set security measures, like disallowing root login or requiring key-based authentication.
- The sshd_config file is an ASCII text based file. Each line that starts with '#' is interpreted as a comment.
