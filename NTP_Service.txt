NTP(Network Time Protocol):
- It is a protocol used to synchronize the time on computer systems within a network. 
  It is commonly used in Linux and other operating systems to ensure that the system's clock is accurate and consistent. 
- The NTP has multiple servers that operate hierarchically.
- The primary time servers known as stratum 1 servers obtain accurate time from highly precise sources, such as atomic clocks or GPS receivers.
- The Stratum 2 servers synchronize their time with Stratum 1 servers, and the hierarchy continues down to lower stratum levels.

Verify NTP Status: sudo systemctl status ntp

The timedatectl command provides information about the system's date, time, and time zone settings. It also indicates whether NTP synchronization is enabled or disabled.
timedatectl status

The /etc/ntp.conf file is the main configuration file for NTP on Linux. It contains directives for server addresses, access restrictions, logging, and more.
