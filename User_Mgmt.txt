/etc/passwd file:
  cat /etc/passwd  //This file shows you a list of users and detailed information about them
  first line in this file most likely looks like this: 
  root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash

  root: it is username

  x: Users password, the password is not really stored in this file, it's usually stored in the /etc/shadow file.
     You can see many different symbols that are in this field, if you see an "x" it means the password is stored in the /etc/shadow file
     if you see a "*" it means the user doesn't have login access. if there is a blank field that means the user doesn't have a password.
  
  0: it means UID
  0: it means group id
  root: GECOS field 
  root: user's home directory
  /bin/bash: User's shell

---

/etc/shadow:
  The /etc/shadow file is used to store information about user authentication. 
  It requires superuser read permissions.
  Command: sudo cat /etc/shadow
  when you run above command output is like this: 
  root:MyEPTEa$6Nonsense:15000:0:99999:7:::

  It means: username, encrypted password , Date of last password changed ,Minimum password age.....

Note: January 1, 1970 is the epoch date for Unix time, the standard for timestamps in computer programming. This date is often called the Unix epoch. 
      Programmers chose this date because it was the closest round date when they invented Unix time. 


w :

- It provides a summary of user activity, including their login time, current processes, and idle time.

su:
- Switch User, used to temporarily switch to another user account from within your current user session.
- by providing password.
- Syntax: su username
- if you use : su then it will switch to root user
- if i use su - username then it means we are permanently switching to that user while if we are using 
  without we are temporarily switching to it and it is just behaving that it switches it.
